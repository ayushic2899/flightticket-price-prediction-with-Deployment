## Overview
Flight Ticket Price Prediction-
 * Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. 
 * We might have often heard travellers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable.
 * Here you will be provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities

It is an regression problem where given a set of features we need to predict the price of ticket from one city to another.
